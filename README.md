# Python Package Exercise - Virtual Pet

## Description

**Virtual Pet** is a Python package for creating and interacting with a virtual pet, providing a playful and nostalgic experience for developers. The pet has attributes like happiness, cleanness, and sleep status, which can be managed through various actions. Users can feed, play with, and take care of their pet by giving it hugs, kisses, or showers, and can even put it to sleep. The virtual pet responds with different emojis based on its current state, adding a whimsical element to the interactions. The goal of this package is to add a bit of joy to everyday coding routines by incorporating a fun, interactive companion.
